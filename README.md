# Dynamics
- No blade flapping
- No stabilizer
- No horizontal/vertical fins
- Centre of Pressure and Centre of Mass are same
- No gyro effects


# Future Work
- Improved dynamics model
- Control Strategies for aggressive maneuvers
- Slung load dynamics implementation
- Scale up to actual helicopters
