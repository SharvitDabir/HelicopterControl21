# HelicopterControl21: 
This project was completed in a group of 4 students as part of a course: 16-745: _"Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2021"_. We explored dynamics of a helicopter, numerical methods for accurate representation of reality, Quaternion mathematics, Group Theory, Disturbance Observer Based Robust Control, Optimal Control and Estimation techniques (Kalman Filtering). 
# Helicopter_DisturbanceObserver_OptimalControl.ipynb
- Implementation of Disturbance Observer Based Control against wind disturbance.

# Helicopter_Model.ipynb
- Implementation of Helicopter dynamics, control and simulation without wind.

# Helicopter_Model_Wind.ipynb
- (TODO: Repeat DOb architecture for Straight Line Trajectory!)

# OCRL_FINAL_REPORT.pdf
- Final project report on Helicopter Optimal Control under wind, submitted for 16-745: _"Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2021"_.

# Dynamics
- No blade flapping
- No stabilizer
- No horizontal/vertical fins
- Centre of Pressure and Centre of Mass are same
